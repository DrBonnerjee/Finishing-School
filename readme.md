**Finishing School**<br>
Bridging India’s Education-to-Employment Gap
Finishing School transforms capable graduates into confident, corporate-ready professionals.
We bridge the space between knowing and doing.
We don’t teach for exams. We prepare for impact.
All programs build four interconnected capabilities: professional communication and corporate presence, 
including business writing, presentations, and executive confidence; applied economic literacy and financial 
acumen for understanding markets, reading P&Ls, and making informed decisions; 
data proficiency using Excel and analytics to turn numbers into insights; and analytical thinking with a 
corporate mindset grounded in evidence-based reasoning, teamwork, and professional judgment.

Our learning methodology is immersive, not lecture-based, combining collaborative cohort-driven sessions with 
1.5 - 2 hours of hands-on tasks, cases, and teamwork each session. 

**Finishing School isn’t a course—it’s a catalyst.**

This repository hosts the HTML-based learning sessions
used in the Finishing School program.
